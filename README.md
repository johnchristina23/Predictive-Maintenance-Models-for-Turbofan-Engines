## Predictive Maintenance for Turbo Engines (RUL Prediction)

Applied machine learning project focused on predictive maintenance using NASA’s turbofan engine degradation dataset. The goal is to accurately predict Remaining Useful Life (RUL) from multivariate sensor time-series data to support data-driven maintenance decisions in industrial systems.

## What This Project Demonstrates

Real-world multivariate time-series modeling

Sequence learning for degradation and failure prediction

Comparison of deep learning architectures for RUL estimation

Practical evaluation of models for industrial predictive maintenance

## Models Implemented

Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)

Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

Reinforcement Learning (RL)–based approach

## Key Results & Insights

LSTM models effectively capture long-term degradation patterns

CNNs learn local temporal features efficiently from sensor data

RL provides a decision-oriented perspective on maintenance policy learning

Model performance highlights trade-offs between accuracy, complexity, and interpretability

## Dataset
